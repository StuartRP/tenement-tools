## Installing (development build only)
Tenement Tools is currently under active development and is not suitable for use in production. If you're interested in testing the current development build, please follow the steps below. Please note: the UI is incomplete and it is likely that you will encounter bugs.
#### 1. Download ArcGIS Pro
First, download and install ArcGIS Pro 2.8. This can be obtained from your organisation's ESRI account. Full instructions are provided here: https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/get-started/download-arcgis-pro.htm. Please note: development build has currently only been tested for ArcGIS Pro v2.8 - other versions may not be compatible.

#### 2. Clone the default ArcGIS Pro Python 3 virtual environment
Tenement Tools relies on several Python 3 libraries that are not enabled in ArcGIS Pro 2.8 by default. In order to enable them, the default Python 3 virtual environment must be cloned and these extra libraries installed into the clone. ESRI has made this process relatively painless. Follow the following steps below:
